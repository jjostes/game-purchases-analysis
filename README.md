## About The Project

Note: The cell outputs for the jupyter notebook were distorted upon pushing the file to GitHub, though they should appear normally when working within the actual notebook.


Assignment Prompt:

"You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for an independent gaming company's fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights."
