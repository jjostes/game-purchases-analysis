-----THREE OBSERVABLE TRENDS-----

1. Player age looks to be normally distributed, with a median range of ages 20-24.

2. There doesn't seem to be much variance between specified genders irt the average amount spent per person as well as the average price of items - if one was wanting to see if there were certain items they could tailor to those demographics. 

3. I suppose a very easy trend to point out is that the majority of players are male, at 84% of the total player count.
